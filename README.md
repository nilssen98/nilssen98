I'm a Full Stack Developer currently contributing my skills to the dynamic world of simulations at OSC. ðŸš€

Proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Java, Kotlin and more, my expertise spans both frontend and backend development. While my primary focus has been on creating captivating user interfaces, I've also delved into backend technologies to ensure a comprehensive approach to application development.

Passionate about creating applications that are not just functional but also a joy to use, I thrive on the challenge of making technology accessible and user-friendly. The intersection of technology and user experience is where I find my stride.
