I'm a Full Stack Developer currently contributing my skills to the dynamic world of simulations at OSC. ðŸš€

Proficient in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Java, Kotlin and more, my expertise spans both frontend and backend development. While my primary focus has been on creating captivating user interfaces, I've also delved into backend technologies to ensure a comprehensive approach to application development.

Passionate about creating applications that are not just functional but also a joy to use, I thrive on the challenge of making technology accessible and user-friendly. The intersection of technology and user experience is where I find my stride.

I'm not just confined to my current tech stack; I'm an avid explorer of new technologies. I thrive on the excitement of learning and enjoy the process of problem-solving. When I'm not immersed in code, you'll likely find me diving into the latest tech trends, always fueled by a curiosity that keeps me on the cutting edge.
